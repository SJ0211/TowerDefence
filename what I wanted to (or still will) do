1. lobby screen
2. death screen
3. different enemies
4. better animation for towers
5. more sound effects
6. more visual effects (explosion when hit, etc)
7. enemy animation
8. better balance (too easy for now)


Why this was harder to do than it looks:
- I wrote 90% of code (all besides wayfinding algorithms and angles)
- I drew all images (30)
- I edited all sounds
- detailed UI
    - Tower available
    - Money
    - Health
    - enemy Health
    - Enemy remaining
    - Waves
    - FPS
- Many sprites layered properly
    -UI
        - Cursor (Has 6 images)
            - Bullets
                - Tower top
                    - Tower Base
                        - Enemy/ally Base
                            - Enemies
                                - Walls
                                    - Background
